# Seattle-AirBNB-Data

"Airbnb, Inc is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. The company is based in San Francisco, California, United States." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb]

The main idea for them is to get new clients that provide real estate listings and new clients that need to rent them because in this way they will get more revenue. A relevant fact is to analyze the behavior of the prices, ratings and the use of the service by the clients along the time.

Based on the above I wanna answer this questions:
1. How does the price of Seattle Airbnb listing vary throughout the year? Additionally, when are the highest and lowest prices?
2. What are the most important factors influencing the ratings of an Airbnb listing?
